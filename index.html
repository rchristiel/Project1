<p>This is a website that taht I created to fulfill the first deliverable for Project 1 in a course I'm learning  in HTML5.</p>
<p>HTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages. It's actually three kinds of code: HTML, which provides the structure; Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which take care of presentation; and JavaScript, which makes things happen.</p>
<p> HTML is the primary area of learning in this course module; therefore, this website will be limited to HTML formatting without CSS or JavaScript until my learning progress.</p>
<p>In this experience you are viewing some of the lessons that has been extremely helpful in my development and learning.</p>
<p>I will attempt to simulate a site whereas the user will be able to access my biographical data and a short narrative of who I am on a separate pages from the homepage.</p>
<p>I currently work in property management with hopes of incorporating my own business along with designing its first website.</p>
<p>Below you'll find a link to a property management company's website. This is the site that I will begin to model my own after.</p>
