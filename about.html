  <p>Hi, my name is Ramzee Christiel and I am a third-year undergraduate student at IIT.</p>
  <p>I am currently in the ITM program with expectations to graduate Spring 2020.</p>
  <p>So far I've learned basics in web development, programming in Java, as well as how to effectively</p>
  <p>manage projects, to just name a few things.I am currently working as a project manager for a company</p>
  <p>that I established and am looking to incorporate by the end of 2018. I've been working in construction for the last 15 years and</p>
  <p>I can honestly say that I take pride in doing quality work whereas the customer is completely satisfied.</p>
  <p>I came to IIT as part of a contingency plan to secure financial freedom in case plan A doesn't work. It's also</P>
  <p>one of my personal goals. My oldest brother was the first of my siblings to graduate college obtaining a Master's</P>
  <p>degree in Computer Science, and I plan to match or surpass him.I had the opportunity to learn and work under a master craftsman</P>
  <p>who taught me the ins and outs of plumbing, carpentry, and electrical systems.</p>
