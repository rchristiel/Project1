<p>This is a website that I created to fulfill the first deliverable for Project 1 in a course I'm learning  in HTML5.</p>
<p>HTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages.</p> 
<p>It's actually three kinds of code: HTML, which provides the structure; Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which take care of</p>
<p>presentation; and JavaScript, which makes things happen. HTML is the primary area of learning in this course module; therefore,</p>
<p>this website will be limited to HTML formatting without CSS or JavaScript until my learning progress.</p>
<p>In this experience you are viewing some of the lessons that has been extremely helpful in my development and learning.</p>
<p>I will attempt to simulate a site whereas the user will be able to access my biographical data and a short narrative of who I am</p>
<p>on a separate pages from the homepage. I currently work in property management with hopes of incorporating my own business</p>
<p>along with designing its first website. Below you'll find a link to a property management company's website. This is the site</p>
<p>that I will begin to model my own after.</p>
